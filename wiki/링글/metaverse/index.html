Hi Min Uk! Thanks for taking your first lesson with me today.

Be sure, while you&rsquo;re learning, to keep your comprehension at a high speed, but let your speaking go at that pace until more clarity is achievable.</p><p>Overall, work on more cohesive phrases. Often, you stop and repeat yourself as you search for what to say - be intentional about practicing your English without repeats, even if it features extra long pauses. It is better to pause and make practice of good, slow English than it is to repeat yourself multiple times over, which your brain will learn as the norm for your speech.</p><p>After that work, be sure to place ideas in-sentence a little more logically. In other words, if one idea is the primary point of emphasis for a given sentence, make sure it is the first item mentioned and the primary grammatical structure around which all other phrases hinge.</p></div><hr><div class=list-files><ul class=section-tree></ul></div></article><script src=/js/wikilink.js></script><div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=minuk-dev/minuk-dev.github.io issue-term=pathname theme=github-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-left></div><div class=footer-right><ul class=social><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/minuk-dev>Github</a></li></ul></div></footer></body><script src=/js/dir_toggle.js></script><script src=/js/codeblock_copy.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css><script type=module>
