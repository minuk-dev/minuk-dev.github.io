# Part I. The Path to Observability
## Chapter 1. What Is Observability?
### The Mathematical Definition of Observability
- Observability : a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.

### Applying Observability to Software Systems
- Understand the inner workings of your application
- Understand any stem state your application may have gotten itself into, even new ones you have never seen before and couldn't have predicted
- Understand the innner workings and system state solely by observing and interrogating with external tools
- Understand the internal state without shipping any new custom code to handle it (because that implies you needed prior knowledge to explain it)
