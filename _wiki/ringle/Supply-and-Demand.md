  - In this article it __had__ Harry Potter story and the questions __were__ unpredicted:
    - 너무 문법을 많이 틀렸는데?
    - 단복수가 진짜 입에 안붙는다. 특히 has, have, had랑 is, are, was, were 이 말하고 나서야 깨닫는 실수들인데 진짜 신경써서 말하자.
  - In this article it had Harry Potter story and the questions were __not what I thought__.:
    - 이거 어렵다. 문장 자체가 어렵거나 표현이 어려운건 아닌데 말하면서 자연스럽게 what ~ 나 how ~를 말하는게 진짜 어려운듯

- I have all books:
  - I have all the books from the series:
    - 처음 배우는 표현, 시리즈 전권을 가지고 있을때 사용하는 표현인데 자주 사용하진 않을것 같지만 알아두면 좋은것 같다. 특히 series 에 from 이 붙는게 독특하다.

- I think I don't get some information from it:
  - But it's very basic
  - I didn't get a lot out of it.

- My favorite book is Faust because whenever I read it, I can feel something different before when I read:
  - than I did before
  - than perviously
  - than I did the last time I read it
  - something new each time
  - 피드백에서 공통적으로 말하는 것은 비교하는 맥락의 문장이니 than을 사용하거나 비교를 없애고 매번 새로웠다는 식으로 말하라는 것이다.

- But there are a lot of points and thinking so I like it:
  - There are lot of __perspectives__
  - 이건 지난번에도 받았던 피드백인데 잘 체화가 안됐다. 다시한번 노력하자

- Before I read it I think it must be lame:
  - not interesting, boring

- But I think for common people a book has their value it is read:
  - a book has its value when it is read

- But if when it is older then it can be more valuable:
  - But if it is older then it becomes more valuable
  - Bue as it gets older then it becaomse more valuable.

- Other things like jewelry - many people just want to show off their wealth:
  - It's somethinkg like jewelry

- I think many people may know it before it will be announced:
  - many people will know it beforehand:
    - I had some warning or advance notice
    - Or insider trading

- Because they would like to hoard the oil before the apply of tax:
  - before the application of the tax
  - before the tax is applied

- When taxes increase, many people may know it before it will be announced.:
  - When taxes increase, many people (acutally) know it beforehand.
