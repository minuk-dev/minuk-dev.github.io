## Memo
## Today's todo
## Today's vocabulary
 * gloaming : twilight; dusk.
   * During the workweek, when we are earning the money to pay for all those expensive gardening implements, it's not possible to do much outside until dusk. Then, with the fireflies, we emerge into the gloaming armed with an arsenal of rakes, pitchforks and spades, like some medieval rabble on its way to battle.
     * arsenal : 병기고
     * rake : 갈퀴
     * pitchfork : 건초용의 쇠스랑
     * spade : 삽
     * rabble : 횡포
   * Fortunately, at certain times and places Mercury is more removed from this all obliterating influence than he is at others, and at such times he may be very distinctly seen, shortly after sunset, twinkling through the gloaming in the west.
     * obliterate : 말살하다

## Weekly todo
 * [ ] Read NOVA paper completely.
 * [ ] Summary NOVA paper.
 * [ ] Mr.Robot 시즌 2 끝내기
