## Today's vocabulary
 * antediluvian : very old, old-fashioned, or out of date; antiquated
   * How can it be that in a country that landed men on the moon, antediluvian locomotives are pusing and pulling dirty, smelly, 50-year-old cars perforated by rust, past crumbling stations, over track that looks like spilled overcooked spaghetti?
   * So my on-the-job training in science writing started in the antediluvian age when magazines and newspapers held a near-monopolistics control over science writing.
