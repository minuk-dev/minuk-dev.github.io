## Today's vocabulary
 * agonist : a person who is torn by inner conflict.
   * There was a fissure in him from the start; the dream and the business did not march together; his will was not always the servant of his intelligence; he was an agonist, a slef-tormentor, who ran to meet suffering halfway.
     * fissure : 갈라진 틈
     * march : 진행하다, 발전하다
     * servant : 하인
     * tormentor : 괴롭히는 사람
     * run to : 어떤 상태에 빠지다
   * He was an agonist. He would argue one way; he would argue another; he just didn't want to see bigotry thrive or watch a man die.
     * bigotry : 편협한 신항
     * thrive : 번창하다
