```
Honestly, I choose this topic more - this topic is more technical, and after I choose it, I acknowledget it - it's not only technical, it's more complext topic.
```

- 자체 피드백:
	- 말을 너무 많이 더듬었다.
	- 지난번 총평과 이번 총평 두번 다 말을 하기 전에 천천히 생각하고 어느 정도 문장을 완성한다음에 말하라고 하는 피드백이 있었으니 좀 더 천천히 말하자.

When I saw question 6, I was taken aback by its gravity; comparing the value of human lives and animal ones is an intense converation. I hadn't considered that it would be a part of the lesson content. I thought: Did I make a mistake?

- saw를 말할때 -ed 발을을 했다는게 놀라웠다. 그리고 여전히 말을 더듬고 있다. 심지어 haven't라고 뱉어놓고 didn't 로 고치고 있다. 고등학생이 되기 전까지 말을 정말 많이 더듬으면서 말했던 걸로 기억하는데, 영어에서도 이 문제를 겪을줄 몰랐다. 고등학교때는 말을 엄청나게 많이 해서 일단 아무 말이나 내뱉어도 이어서 말할 수 있도록 순간 대응력을 늘리는 것을 목표로 연습해서 이를 고쳤던것 같은데.. 쉽지 않을 것 같다.

When I learn the AI - i'm - I didn't think the AI is nearly intelligence, because it's only the think, just make it with mathematic, and people said machine can be learning but I don't think machine learning is really learning because it is - it's very different to comparing to teaching our kid - it's just mathematic and calculus, it's based on only calculus.
```

```
AI is popular understood as a learning machine. I am skeptical: I don't think machine learning resembles anything beyound a mathematical approximation of the process. A machine that is 'learning' in the sense that we use it now undergoes very different stressors, inputs, and experiences than the education of a human child. Its world is all mathematics and calculus; it's based only on calculus.

In the summer of 2018 or 19, I participated in the Google AI contest. They provided us with two problems; the first was easy. We were to categorize cats and dogs. The second problem was not so simple. We were to predict the alternate/opposite side of a car given data about the surface of one of the sides. While I didn't win a prize, i am certainly grateful to have had the experience.
