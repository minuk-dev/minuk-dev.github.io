&lt;li>내가 말한 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Honestly, I choose this topic more - this topic is more technical, and after I choose it, I acknowledget it - it&amp;#39;s not only technical, it&amp;#39;s more complext topic.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>자체 피드백:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>말을 너무 많이 더듬었다.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>지난번 총평과 이번 총평 두번 다 말을 하기 전에 천천히 생각하고 어느 정도 문장을 완성한다음에 말하라고 하는 피드백이 있었으니 좀 더 천천히 말하자.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;li>내가 말한 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>When I sawed question - question 6, it&amp;#39;s comparing the value of human life and the life on, and animla. When I saw it, I am so surpised, because I haven&amp;#39;t - don&amp;#39;t think about it. Did I make a mistake?
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>첨삭 받은 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>When I saw question 6, I was taken aback by its gravity; comparing the value of human lives and animal ones is an intense converation. I hadn&amp;#39;t considered that it would be a part of the lesson content. I thought: Did I make a mistake?
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>saw를 말할때 -ed 발을을 했다는게 놀라웠다. 그리고 여전히 말을 더듬고 있다. 심지어 haven&amp;rsquo;t라고 뱉어놓고 didn&amp;rsquo;t 로 고치고 있다. 고등학생이 되기 전까지 말을 정말 많이 더듬으면서 말했던 걸로 기억하는데, 영어에서도 이 문제를 겪을줄 몰랐다. 고등학교때는 말을 엄청나게 많이 해서 일단 아무 말이나 내뱉어도 이어서 말할 수 있도록 순간 대응력을 늘리는 것을 목표로 연습해서 이를 고쳤던것 같은데.. 쉽지 않을 것 같다.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>내가 말한 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>When I learn the AI - i&amp;#39;m - I didn&amp;#39;t think the AI is nearly intelligence, because it&amp;#39;s only the think, just make it with mathematic, and people said machine can be learning but I don&amp;#39;t think machine learning is really learning because it is - it&amp;#39;s very different to comparing to teaching our kid - it&amp;#39;s just mathematic and calculus, it&amp;#39;s based on only calculus.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>첨삭 받은 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>AI is popular understood as a learning machine. I am skeptical: I don&amp;#39;t think machine learning resembles anything beyound a mathematical approximation of the process. A machine that is &amp;#39;learning&amp;#39; in the sense that we use it now undergoes very different stressors, inputs, and experiences than the education of a human child. Its world is all mathematics and calculus; it&amp;#39;s based only on calculus.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>부정형으로 말할때, be동사, do/does/did, have/has/had 를 말할때 엄청 틀린다. 어떻게 해야지 자연스럽게 나올까?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>내가 말한 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>I learned that. I&amp;#39;m participated in Google AI contest in maybe 2018 or 19, in Summer, they - the contest aksed to us just categorizing cat and dog. And second problem is predicting other surface of the car - they just - this [] has just one side of car, and predicting the other side. I&amp;#39;m not - I didn&amp;#39;t win a prize but the experience is surely valuable.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>첨삭받은 문장&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>In the summer of 2018 or 19, I participated in the Google AI contest. They provided us with two problems; the first was easy. We were to categorize cats and dogs. The second problem was not so simple. We were to predict the alternate/opposite side of a car given data about the surface of one of the sides. While I didn&amp;#39;t win a prize, i am certainly grateful to have had the experience.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>시간을 제일 처음에 말하려고 노력하자. 지금까지 시간이 들어가있는 문장들은 모조리 제일 처음에 시간을 말하도록 첨삭받았다.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>링글/Metaverse</title><link>https://minuk.dev/wiki/%EB%A7%81%EA%B8%80/metaverse/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 13:26:34 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://minuk.dev/wiki/%EB%A7%81%EA%B8%80/metaverse/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>First, in the past, AI - maching learning was introduced in 1980s, but computer was not good, so - [] baybe, but there is no hardware.

&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>In the 1980s, machine learning was introduced, but the necessary hardware to test it at scale was not sufficient.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>In the 1980s, machine learning was theoretically possible, but the extent hardware of the time could not match those theoretical requirements.
