 &lt;pre>&lt;code>When I saw question 6, I was taken aback by its gravity; comparing the value of human lives and animal ones is an intense converation. I hadn&amp;#39;t considered that it would be a part of the lesson content. I thought: Did I make a mistake?&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;li>saw를 말할때 -ed 발을을 했다는게 놀라웠다. 그리고 여전히 말을 더듬고 있다. 심지어 haven&amp;rsquo;t라고 뱉어놓고 didn&amp;rsquo;t 로 고치고 있다. 고등학생이 되기 전까지 말을 정말 많이 더듬으면서 말했던 걸로 기억하는데, 영어에서도 이 문제를 겪을줄 몰랐다. 고등학교때는 말을 엄청나게 많이 해서 일단 아무 말이나 내뱉어도 이어서 말할 수 있도록 순간 대응력을 늘리는 것을 목표로 연습해서 이를 고쳤던것 같은데.. 쉽지 않을 것 같다.&lt;/li>

 &lt;pre>&lt;code>When I learn the AI - i&amp;#39;m - I didn&amp;#39;t think the AI is nearly intelligence, because it&amp;#39;s only the think, just make it with mathematic, and people said machine can be learning but I don&amp;#39;t think machine learning is really learning because it is - it&amp;#39;s very different to comparing to teaching our kid - it&amp;#39;s just mathematic and calculus, it&amp;#39;s based on only calculus.&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

 &lt;pre>&lt;code>AI is popular understood as a learning machine. I am skeptical: I don&amp;#39;t think machine learning resembles anything beyound a mathematical approximation of the process. A machine that is &amp;#39;learning&amp;#39; in the sense that we use it now undergoes very different stressors, inputs, and experiences than the education of a human child. Its world is all mathematics and calculus; it&amp;#39;s based only on calculus.&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
