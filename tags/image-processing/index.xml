Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors The prefix eigen- is adopted from the German word eigen for &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;characteristic&amp;rdquo; Eigenvalues are a special set of scalars associated with a linear system of equations that are sometimes also known as characteristic roots, characteristic values Each eigenvalue is paired with a corresponding so-called eigen vector. Eigenvectors are a special set of vectors associated with a linear system of equations that are sometimes also known as characteristic vectors The Lanczos algorithm is an algorithm for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors Eigenvalues and eigenvectors feature prominently in the analysis of transformations Covariance matrix The covariance matrix consists of the variances of the variables along the main diagonal and the covariance between each pair of variables in the other matrix positions Face Recognition obtain face images I_1, &amp;hellip; , I_m (training faces) (very important : the face images must be centered and of the same size)</description></item></channel></rss>
