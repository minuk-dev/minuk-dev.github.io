The output is in non-decreasing order: each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired total order The output is a permutation meaning that a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements of the input.</description></item><item><title>lectures/computer architecture</title><link>http://makerdark98.dev/wiki/lectures/computer-architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 20:37:08 +0900</pubDate><guid>http://makerdark98.dev/wiki/lectures/computer-architecture/</guid><description>Large and Fast : Exploiting Memory Hierarchy5. Principle of Locality Temporal locality Spatial locality Taking Advantage of Locality Memory hierarchy Store everything on disk (lowest level) Copy recently accessed (and nearby) items from disk to smaller DRAM(e.g. Main Memory) copy more recently accessed (and nearby) items from DRAM to smaller SRAM memory(e.g. Cache memory attached to CPU) Memory Hierarchy Levels A block (aka line) : unit of copying If accessed data is present in upper level Hit : access satisfied by upper level Hit ratio: hits/accesses If accessed data is absent Miss : block copied from lower level Time taken : miss penalty Miss ratio : misses/accesses = 1 - hit ratio Then accessed data supplied from upper level Memory Technology Static RAM (SRAM) : 0.</description></item><item><title>lectures/image processing</title><link>http://makerdark98.dev/wiki/lectures/image-processing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 20:37:08 +0900</pubDate><guid>http://makerdark98.dev/wiki/lectures/image-processing/</guid><description>PCA (Principal Components Analysis)
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors The prefix eigen- is adopted from the German word eigen for &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;characteristic&amp;rdquo; Eigenvalues are a special set of scalars associated with a linear system of equations that are sometimes also known as characteristic roots, characteristic values Each eigenvalue is paired with a corresponding so-called eigen vector. Eigenvectors are a special set of vectors associated with a linear system of equations that are sometimes also known as characteristic vectors The Lanczos algorithm is an algorithm for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors Eigenvalues and eigenvectors feature prominently in the analysis of transformations Covariance matrix The covariance matrix consists of the variances of the variables along the main diagonal and the covariance between each pair of variables in the other matrix positions Face Recognition obtain face images I_1, &amp;hellip; , I_m (training faces) (very important : the face images must be centered and of the same size)</description></item><item><title>학교 수업</title><link>http://makerdark98.dev/wiki/lectures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 20:37:08 +0900</pubDate><guid>http://makerdark98.dev/wiki/lectures/</guid><description>학교 수업 [[lectures/algorithm]] [[lectures/computer architecture]] [[lectures/image processing]]</description></item></channel></rss>
